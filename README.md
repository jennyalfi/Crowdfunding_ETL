# ETL-project2

This project builds an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods or regular expressions. The goal is to extract and transform the data, followed by creating four CSV files. These CSV files will then be used to generate an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and a table schema. Finally, the transformed data will be uploaded into a Postgres database.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Postgres

## Project Steps

1. Extract and Transform Data:
   - Use Python and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data.

2. Create CSV Files:
   - After transforming the data, create four CSV files to store the processed data.

3. Generate ERD and Table Schema:
   - Utilize the CSV file data to create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) that visually represents the relationships between different entities.
   - Create a table schema based on the transformed data, outlining the structure of the tables.

4. Upload Data to Postgres Database:
   - Take the transformed data from the CSV files and upload it into a Postgres database.
